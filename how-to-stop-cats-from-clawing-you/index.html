<p>I would not be in favour of de-clawing the kitten as a cat needs its claws for many purposes other than scratching you and the furniture. Claw trimming should be done regularly anyway to keep cats claws from becoming ingrown. If your cat is scratching furniture or wallpaper to maintain its claws cover the scratched surface with thick plastic sheeting to prevent your cat from scratching there. However a cat that has little opportunity to walk on hard surfaces may well need its claws trimmed regularly to prevent them from getting too long. Pin On Random.</p>
