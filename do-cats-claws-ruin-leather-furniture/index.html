<p><strong>Do Cats Claws Ruin Leather Furniture</strong>, There are actually a number of felines who like to take their claws to leather so if it. Scratching allows the cat to shed the outer claw and reveal the new sharper and stronger claws. The furniture may be slightly scratched from their running across it or jumping on it but my experience is that cats dont like to sharpen their claws on leather. They do this because the muscles that control their claws need to be stretched and strengthened.</p>
