<p>You can use leather touch-up paint. CLEAN THE AREA As with all quality leather repairs and restorations the first step is to ensure the area is free from dirt and contaminants. Rub over the scratch with the crayon and the rub it with your finger until it melts into the leather and smooths over the scratch. Cat scratches on the other hand usually require repair.

<p>Apply lanolin oil to the scratch. Rub it into the leather with strokes of your finger going first at 90 degrees then at the same direction as the scratch. Once clean leave the area to dry naturally for approximately 5-10 minutes. It would also help to try to redirect its focus before it starts scratching at the couch to help avoid rewarding the behavior.
