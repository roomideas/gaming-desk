<p>Make sure you also check our guide to the best touch pads. A small kids desk might measure 36 x 24 x 30 inches (w x d x h) (92 x 61 x 76cm) there really isn�t a standard size. As a rule, the common dimensions for a desk are 60 inches wide, 30 inches deep, and between 25 and 30 inches in height.

My options are a 59 desk which supports 110lbs, and has no extension capabilities, or a 63 desk which supports 175lbs and extension possibilities if needed. These lamps can produce uneven lighting on the desk, and often are awkward to properly position. Your thoughts about size and consistency.</p>
